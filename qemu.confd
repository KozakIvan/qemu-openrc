##
# Network interfaces
#
# You can specify up to 10 NICs using variables netX and netX_OPTION. For list
# of available options open man qemu and find -netdev.
#
# MAC address of the NIC is automatically generated from the VM name and
# sequence number of the NIC, so it's always the same for particular VM and NIC
# and it should be unique as well. You can override the MAC address with
# variable netX_mac.
#
# These NICs will use driver virtio-net-pci (requires virtio-net driver to be
# installed in the VM).
#
# Example:
#   net0="bridge"
#   net0_mac="52:54:12:34:56:78"
#

##
# Hard-drives
#
# You can specify up to 10 drives using variables diskX_OPTION. For list of
# available options open man qemu and find -drive.
#
# These drives will use driver scsi-disk connected to virtio-scsi-pci (requires
# virtio-scsi drivers to be installed in the VM).
#
# Example:
#   disk0_file="/dev/mapper/${vm_name}-disk0"
#   disk0_format="raw"
#   disk0_cache="none"
#
#   disk1_file="/var/lib/qemu/${vm_name}/disk0.qcow2"
#   disk1_format="qcow2"
#

##
# CD-ROMs
#
# You can specify up to 10 cdrom drives using variables cdromX_file.
#
# These drives will use driver ide-cd connected to an emulated IDE controller
# (no virtio). This is slow, but doesn't require any special drivers in the VM.
#
# Example:
#   cdrom0_file="/var/lib/qemu/virtio-win.iso"
#
